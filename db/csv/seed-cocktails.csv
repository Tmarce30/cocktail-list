Mojito,"If there is one cocktail to divide opinion, it is surely the omnipresent Mojito cocktail. Some say it is a pain in the arse to make, is too frequently made badly, and is the mascot for unadventurous drinkers everywhere. Others say it is a refreshing and easy drinking cocktail that has introduced millions to the wonders of the mixed drink. Whatever side of the fence you sit on, it’s certainly helped line the pockets of a few mint-growers.",Add the white rum to a highball glass. Add 8 – 10 mint leaves and sugar syrup and lime juice.Muddle with bar spoon. Add crushed ice and a splash of soda. Mix drink down with bar spoon. Taste. Top up with more crushed ice.

Martini,"Some would argue that the Martini Cocktail is the greatest cocktail of them all and certainly the most iconic. The Martini cocktail is quite a simple cocktail in theory, made with just gin & vermouth and garnished either with an olive or a lemon twist.The challenge in making a good Martini is knowing what ratio of gin and vermouth to use and this will often come down to the preference of the drinker. Legend has it that Winston Churchill was said to whisper the word “vermouth” to a freshly poured glass of gin. The Martini can be shaken or stirred although, despite the best efforts of 007, it is general advocated stirring produces the superior cocktail.","Chill martini glass with soda water and ice. Fill mixing glass to top with ice. Add the dry vermouth to the mixing glass, giving a small stir to coat the ice with the vermouth. Drain out glass, leaving just the coating on the ice. Add the gin to the mixing glass. Stir for 15 seconds, always making sure that the glass is full to the brim with ice. Taste. Fine strain into chilled martini glass. Zest with lemon peel and add twist unto drink.",http://res.cloudinary.com/dohmz3y7y/image/upload/v1519901170/s2cx3riofrxu9gv6otut.jpg

Caipirinha,"To make a Caipirinha you need Cachaca, and to make Cachaca you need sugar cane juice. Which is important, because it is what makes Cachaca a Cachaca, and not a rum. After that it follows a pretty similar path to rum, with the juice being fermented and then this liquid distilled. Sometimes the distilled liquid is popped in a barrel to go all smooth for sipping, but that’s no good for a Caipirinha where it’s all about the raw funky flavors.","Cut 1/2 lime into 1/8 ths and add half of these to Rocks glass. Add teaspoon of brown sugar and muddle the ingredients. Add the rest of the lime and continue to muddle, to dissolve the sugar. Add the Cachaca and then add crushed ice on top.

Margarita,"If there is one cocktail which I have been served more bad versions of than any other, it is the Margarita cocktail. The simple mix of tequila, Cointreau and lime juice just should’t be that hard to mess up, but many do, disgracefully so.

Even this may not be the true origins, for the idea of mixing spirit with citrus juice and sugar has been recorded as early as early as 1866.",Begin by half soaking rim of coupe glass with lime juice and then dab in salt.

Sex on the Beach,"The history of the Sex on the Beach cocktail is a little hazy but the most cited story dates back to 1987 when a company called National Distribution began selling peach schnapps, which was new to America at the time. The company came up with a contest in Ft Lauderdale, Florida that they would pay the bar who sold the most peach schnapps $1000 dollars and the bartender who was responsible for the most sales $100. A bartender called Ted Pizio, who worked at a bar called Confettis, mixed vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and grenadine and the drink started to become very popular. When Ted was asked what it was called, he thought of the reason thousands of people came to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break and he called it the “Sex on the Beach”. When people returned to the area and asked for a Sex on the Beach cocktail, many of the local bartenders didn’t know the recipe and hence many variations came into existence and still remain to this day.","The Sex on the Beach cocktail is a very popular mixed drink which is the epitome of easy drinking. This fruity highball is a mix of vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and cranberry juice and tends to be very popular on hot summer evenings on the beach. There is another version of the Sex on the Beach cocktail which is made with vodka, Chambord, Melon liqueur, pineapple juice and cranberry juice. Although this drink is predominantly served as a highball, some bars will also serve it as a shooter. One popular variation of the Sex on the Beach is a Woo Woo which is the same drink only made without the orange juice.",http://res.cloudinary.com/dohmz3y7y/image/upload/v1519901252/xca3dpkkcn1okzfk6nqd.jpg
