Sex on the Beach,"The history of the Sex on the Beach cocktail is a little hazy but the most cited story dates back to 1987 when a company called National Distribution began selling peach schnapps, which was new to America at the time. The company came up with a contest in Ft Lauderdale, Florida that they would pay the bar who sold the most peach schnapps $1000 dollars and the bartender who was responsible for the most sales $100. A bartender called Ted Pizio, who worked at a bar called Confettis, mixed vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and grenadine and the drink started to become very popular. When Ted was asked what it was called, he thought of the reason thousands of people came to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break and he called it the “Sex on the Beach”. When people returned to the area and asked for a Sex on the Beach cocktail, many of the local bartenders didn’t know the recipe and hence many variations came into existence and still remain to this day.","The Sex on the Beach cocktail is a very popular mixed drink which is the epitome of easy drinking.
