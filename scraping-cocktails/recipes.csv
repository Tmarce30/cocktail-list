Legend has it that Winston Churchill was said to whisper the word “vermouth” to a freshly poured glass of gin. The Martini can be shaken or stirred although, despite the best efforts of 007, it is general advocated stirring produces the superior cocktail.","Chill martini glass with soda water and ice. Fill mixing glass to top with ice. Add the dry vermouth to the mixing glass, giving a small stir to coat the ice with the vermouth. Drain out glass, leaving just the coating on the ice.

Caipirinha,"To make a Caipirinha you need Cachaca, and to make Cachaca you need sugar cane juice. Which is important, because it is what makes Cachaca a Cachaca, and not a rum. After that it follows a pretty similar path to rum, with the juice being fermented and then this liquid distilled. Sometimes the distilled liquid is popped in a barrel to go all smooth for sipping, but that’s no good for a Caipirinha where it’s all about the raw funky flavors.","Cut 1/2 lime into 1/8 ths and add half of these to Rocks glass.

Margarita,"If there is one cocktail which I have been served more bad versions of than any other, it is the Margarita cocktail. The simple mix of tequila, Cointreau and lime juice just should’t be that hard to mess up, but many do, disgracefully so. Often considered one of ‘the classics’, with several different stories laying claim to its creation, it is in fact pre-dated in written reference at least by a cocktail with the same recipe as the classic Margarita, but named the Picador and dating back to the 1930s. Even this may not be the true origins, for the idea of mixing spirit with citrus juice and sugar has been recorded as early as early as 1866.",Begin by half soaking rim of coupe glass with lime juice and then dab in salt.
