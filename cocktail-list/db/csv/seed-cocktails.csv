Mojito,"If there is one cocktail to divide opinion, it is surely the omnipresent Mojito cocktail.

Martini,"Some would argue that the Martini Cocktail is the greatest cocktail of them all and certainly the most iconic. The Martini cocktail is quite a simple cocktail in theory, made with just gin & vermouth and garnished either with an olive or a lemon twist.The challenge in making a good Martini is knowing what ratio of gin and vermouth to use and this will often come down to the preference of the drinker. Legend has it that Winston Churchill was said to whisper the word ÒvermouthÓ to a freshly poured glass of gin. The Martini can be shaken or stirred although, despite the best efforts of 007, it is general advocated stirring produces the superior cocktail.","Chill martini glass with soda water and ice. Fill mixing glass to top with ice. Add the dry vermouth to the mixing glass, giving a small stir to coat the ice with the vermouth. Drain out glass, leaving just the coating on the ice.

Caipirinha,"To make a Caipirinha you need Cachaca, and to make Cachaca you need sugar cane juice. Which is important, because it is what makes Cachaca a Cachaca, and not a rum.

Sometimes the distilled liquid is popped in a barrel to go all smooth for sipping, but thatÕs no good for a Caipirinha where itÕs all about the raw funky flavors.","Cut 1/2 lime into 1/8 ths and add half of these to Rocks glass.

Sex on the Beach,"The history of the Sex on the Beach cocktail is a little hazy but the most cited story dates back to 1987 when a company called National Distribution began selling peach schnapps, which was new to America at the time. The company came up with a contest in Ft Lauderdale, Florida that they would pay the bar who sold the most peach schnapps $1000 dollars and the bartender who was responsible for the most sales $100. A bartender called Ted Pizio, who worked at a bar called Confettis, mixed vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and grenadine and the drink started to become very popular. When Ted was asked what it was called, he thought of the reason thousands of people came to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break and he called it the ÒSex on the BeachÓ. When people returned to the area and asked for a Sex on the Beach cocktail, many of the local bartenders didnÕt know the recipe and hence many variations came into existence and still remain to this day.","The Sex on the Beach cocktail is a very popular mixed drink which is the epitome of easy drinking. This fruity highball is a mix of vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice and cranberry juice and tends to be very popular on hot summer evenings on the beach.
